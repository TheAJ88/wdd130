        Welcome to Forewood! Now, a small suburban town in the middle of nowhere might sound ridiculously cliché as the setting of a teenage story but bear with us, we pack a few surprises! 
        When you’re not visiting the beach a few hours away, climbing the hills, or trying out our cute little bakeries, we have broken friendships, relationship drama, gamers competing for glory, long lost ghostwriters, cyberpunk snipers, teenagers being teenagers, and of course your dose of good feelings to balance everything out.
        Whaddya say then reader? Wanna give Forewood a shot? Hey, we have pretty low rent!


      </p>
      <p>DISCLAIMER:
        Good Feelings is an entirely fictional story in a fictional setting. The story deals with many mature themes so please feel free to stop reading or skip chapters if you feel uncomfortable. I did not write this story to offend anyone so if you do feel offended, please know it is not intentional. I’m just trying to tell a good story. 
        At the end of the day, it’s just that, a story.</p>

        Hello! My name's Akshat Johanan and I’m the author of Good Feelings. I love music and writing which is why I decided to create this chaotic mess of both. I’ve always loved stories which is why I love writing. When I’m not haunted by my writing ideas, I fence, play D&D, play games, watch movies, anime, and tv shows. I’m currently a college student studying Computer Science which is amazing. I’m already learning so much in my real life to implement into my stories which is amazing. Being a writer means compiling all your experiences, feelings, and opinions into a database to draw ideas from which is just insanely cool. All writers are magicians in their own ways, creating worlds and filling them with life. Except bad writers. They just end up with Rey Not-Skywalker.
