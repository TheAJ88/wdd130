    <p>Hey everyone, my name's Akshat. I realize that's hard to pronounce so I go by AJ which is way too cool of a nickname for me.</p>
    <p class = "background">I come from a beautiful coastal town named Vizag which is in India.</p>
    <p>I love doing a lot of stuff but the most prominent are writing, playing games, talking about weird stuff, and yes, programming.</p>
    <p>Now, let's see Paul Allen's html.</p>
