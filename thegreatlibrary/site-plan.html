      <p> Welcome to the Great Library. I am your host, Arvan Illshari of the ninth sun. Fancy magical name, I know. I am the keeper of the great library that hosts every story that has ever been written or ever could be written. Unlike most fictional ideas conjured by men, the ancients know that reality is too unpredictable hence why the Khaos section of the library exists to keep track of possible future events.  
        The library has always been the greatest kept secret of Reality. Forget sorcerers, even Tomeseekers haven’t been able to find us. So please do not try, lest you face the cosmic consequences.
        Now come, rest your feet, and feast your eyes. Congratulations are in order because you get a sneak peek at stories that are being created and forming realities.

      <h3>ARCHIVE OF THE ARCHAIC</h3>
      <p>This is where the stories will be shown. The writing on this page would go like:</p>
      <p> GOOD FEELINGS: Reality Zenta Nine. Long for R-ZE9. The author is still stuck working on the story, so the reality is still forming, 
        stuck in its chaos stage. From my research, I was able to gather that the world follows the storyline of a teenager trying to find his 
        bearings in life. Cliched for sure, but intriguing nonetheless. I suppose you'll have to read it yourself to figure it out.</p>
             
       <p>ELEMENTUS: Reality Unknown. This one is even more chaotic than R-ZE9. Dimensional portals, cults, secret orders, Undead Gods, Alien civilizations, friendships, and magic. But from the chaos I was able to receive four messages. The protagonists of the story I presume.</p>
             
       <p>THARUN: We're not well-formed characters yet so I can't say much, but hi, I'm Tharun. I'm one of the protagonists of ELEMENTUS. It's going to be a good story, but you won’t know for a while because the stupid creator's taking too much time. Gen Z I swear.</p>
       <p>KENNY: Ayo! Alright let's do this one last time, my name is Kenny Sebastian. I was bitten by a radioactive- no I'm kidding ha! ELEMENTUS is gonna be SIIIIICK. I don’t know much but hey, it sounds cool!</p>
       <p>HARSHA: Um, hello, hi. I'm Harsha. I'm from Visakhapatnam. I, uh, like hanging out with my friends. I like chicken biriyani. Does that work? Oh yeah, ELEMENTUS. It’s fun. I like it.</p>
       <p>DARREN: Yeah, yeah I know, you’re already judging my friends and me. No worries there, you have every right to. Even our story sounds like a bloody cliché. But hey, at the risk of sounding stupid, I think the story is gonna turn out good.</p>

      <h3>ABOUT CREATOR</h3>
      <p>
        Hello! My name's Akshat Johanan and I’m the author of the stories Arvan has so carefully showcased. I also created him but he doesn't like admitting to that. It's always weird when authors talk like that right? My bad. I love music and writing which is why I decided to create chaotic messes of both. I’ve always loved stories which is why I love writing. When I’m not haunted by my writing ideas, I fence, play D&D, play games, watch movies, anime, and tv shows. I’m currently a college student studying Computer Science which is amazing. I’m already learning so much in my real life to implement into my stories which is amazing. Being a writer means compiling all your experiences, feelings, and opinions into a database to draw ideas from which is just insanely cool. All writers are magicians in their own ways, creating worlds and filling them with life. Except bad writers. They just end up with Rey Not-Skywalker.
